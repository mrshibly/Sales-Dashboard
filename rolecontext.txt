🧩 Sales Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System — Bangladesh-Based Sales Organization
📌 Project Overview
This project implements a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system for a sales organization operating across Bangladesh. The system is designed to map each user to a geographic region (Division → District → Upazila → Territory), and assign permissions based on their sales hierarchy level.

This ensures data privacy, operational clarity, and regional accountability for all users in the system.

🔁 Sales Role Hierarchy
Each role has a defined scope of access based on their position in the sales chain:

HOM (Head of Marketing)
└── NSM (National Sales Manager)
    └── DSM (Divisional Sales Manager)
        └── ASM (Area Sales Manager)
            └── TSM (Territory Sales Manager)
                └── SR (Sales Representative)
🌍 Geographic Hierarchy (Bangladesh Structure)
The system maps users and data geographically:

Division (8 total)
└── District (~64 total)
    └── Upazila / Area (~495 total)
        └── Territory (smaller segments under each Upazila)
Each user is linked to a location level:

Role	Assigned To
SR	Territory (within an Upazila)
TSM	Upazila
ASM	District
DSM	Division
NSM	Country-wide
HOM	Full system access

🧠 Key Concepts for Implementation
Users are tied to a location level in the geographic hierarchy.

All CRUD permissions are cascaded downward from the top role to ensure hierarchical visibility and control.

Region-based filtering is implemented to isolate what users can access.

Targets, customers, orders, users and analytics are all scoped by role + location.
